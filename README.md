# RSL_recognition
This is repository of my bachelor's work "Sign language words recognition on video".\
The goal of the work was to develop neural network's architecture to predict the russian sign language word on video, using only hand landmarks, so that algorithm would be more general and could be used in situations when the singer's emotions, face is unvailable.\
Even though, this solution uses much less data than solutions based on video, it requires much less time resources to learn and still has good accuracy 44.3% for 1000 classes and 15 train and 5 test objects for each class.\
Dataset used in this work is russian language dataset named Slovo [1].\
inference_only.py - script for trained model inference\
pipeline.py - script for model training pipeline.\
You can read my bachelor's work and watch slides in "bach_work" folder (in Russian)\
Also I already made and published dataset with tensors padded to 256 frames, so there is no need in parcing json\
